## Welcome

This is my first time programming a game engine. I am doing this because I don't quite like other engines. Don't get me wrong, those engines are really cool, but I prefer something else, something that I can 100% understand and modify without blowing my mind.

I never thought I would be able to do something like this, but here I am, creating a 3D game engine in java, that's crazy.

## Citadel engine

This engine is going to be used for my future games and projects, but if people really like it, I could add support for using it outside my own projects.

<b>Features</b>:
- 3D rendering.
- Batching.
- Sound, OGG files.
- Log system that saves the log-buffer into a log file and prevents crashes without a "crash-log file".
- Profiler.
- Event system.

<b>Working on</b>:
- Textures.
- Frustum culling.
- Registry system to add content dynamically.
- Optimization.

<b>Planned</b>:
- Object culling.
- Better configuration for initializing the engine.
- Config system.
- Steamworks compatibility.
- Mipmaps.
- Lighting.
