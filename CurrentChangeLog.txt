Multiple upgrades to the game engine:

- Change log file created to help me keep track of all the things I changed.
- FileManager.extractFileFromJar fixed, now it uses the original extension instead of .tmp. It also creates a temp folder to keep track of the files. It also keeps the original file name.
- Now the build.gradle reads gradle.properties to name the .exe file and main class.
- Now textures extracts the images to the temp directory.
- DebugLogger now supports Objects.
- Now the ModelLoader extracts assets that could be used in aiImportFile -> extractPossibleNeededAssets(String modelPath)
